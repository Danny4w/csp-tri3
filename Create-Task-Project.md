**College Board Requirments**

**Program Overview**: 
In our program, we plan on taking an INPUT from the USER. It will ask for an input, (less than, greater than, or equal to) and the code will store numbers ranging from 1 - 100. Our program will have to guess the number that the user is thinking of and the possible numbers will be put into a list, and once the user selects a button, the procedure will be called and determine what numbers must be kept or eliminated. Then it will display the function result: how many tries it took and whether the program was correct or not.

**Inputs**:
Inputs will be given as radio buttons for the user to select. If the user does not select an option, a proper response will be displayed.

**Lists**:
Lists will be exhibited inside the code. The program will have to store values from 1-100, because the option of less than, greater than, or equal to will cause the code to eliminate certain values.

**Procedure**:
Procedure for us will be limited by the inputs the user gives, as well as a 5 number limit, and it will be named 'comparisonInput()' which will be called on later.

**Sequencing**: 
Sequencing will be shown in the 'for' loops that will be inside our functions, having 'if' and 'else' statements in proper ordering to determine things like the max number in a list, the min number, and when to add to i to go through the list.

**Selection**: 
Selection will be shown in our 'if ' and 'else' statements, to select if a certain variable will be chosen to go in the front of a list (min/max).

**Iteration**: 
Iteration will be shown by going through each element inside of our lists using the 'for i in range'

**Output**
Inputs from our users will be run through our html file, where the output will be called to finally print it to the user. This output will be determined by the user input, and will vary depending on what numbers are put in. This will be put into our games page as a PBL project.

**Video Plans**: 
Our plans for video will likely start off by showcasing code content, with text to narrate what pieces of code showcase what. Then afterwards, we will do 1 run for each output of the program.

**Written Responses**: 
Our plans for the written responses are encapsulated by our Initial create task project overview, and explaining how the program implements into our project's games page, the procedures the user input goes through to return the output, and explains how the numbers they give play a role in the output.
