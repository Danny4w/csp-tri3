# Lecture Video Notes

- On this page you will find notes to college board video lectures completed over a 3 week period(Weeks 5-7).

 
## Week 5

### Creative Development

**CRD 1**

- Incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed. 
- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function. 
- Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.
- Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations. 
- Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations. 
- Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives. 
- Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents. 
- Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration.
- Effective collaborative teams
  - communication 
  - consensus building 
  - conflict resolution 
  - Negotiation


**CRD 2**

- The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression. 
- An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation. 
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. 
- Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. 
- A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature. 
- There are multiple development processes which include 
  - investigating and reflecting
  - designing 
  - prototyping 
  - testing 
- Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program
- constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
- Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: 
  - collecting data through surveys 
  - user testing 
  - interviews 
  - direct observations
- A programâ€™s specification defines the requirements for the program
- In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification
- The design phase of a program may include:
  - Brainstorming  
  - planning and storyboarding 
  - creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface 
  - development of a testing strategy for the program
- Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed. 
- A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. 
- A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed. 
- A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own runtime errors.
- An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values. 
- Most Effective way to find and correct errors: 
  - test cases 
  - hand tracing 
  - visualizations 
  - debuggers
