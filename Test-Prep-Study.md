**5.1 Beneficial & Harmful Effects**
- People create computing innovations
- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
  - A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person
  - Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
- Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended: 
  - The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community 
  - Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels
  - Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to   discriminate against groups of individuals
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture 
- Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
-  It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
- Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields
- Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- Some beneficial effects of computing is that it makes a lot of things easier. By being able to effectively communicate using technology or having greater access to resources you're able to inform yourself more about the world around you. Some of the harmful effects of computing is that you tend to become too reliant on these technologies. This can provoke all sorts of health problems in the future. 
 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- The dopamine issues mentioned above are a real problem. I don’t think that it is just a conspiracy because as explained in the example, dopamine plays a big role in how we feel pleasure, and wanting to re-experience that same level of pleasure means you need a greater dopamine rush than before. This could impact many aspects of life and could result in mood swings as well. 

**5.2 Digital Divide**

- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
  - The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
  - The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
  - The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- You can empower yourself in a digital world by staying informed about technologies and using them in your daily life. Being educated and provided with tech will help empower people in a digital environment. 

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS
- Someone that is empowered can help someone that may not be empowered by providing them with a secure network or their devices with them. For example, at Del Norte, I could give my hotspot to people that may not have strong access to the internet so that they could use online services or I can share a device with them. 

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Redtaping is blocking digital empowerment because it makes people have to follow additional steps in order to access information or technologies. We see this type of thing occurring in many circumstances, not necessarily in just tech. We have similar barriers at Del Norte when we try to connect ourselves to web services through a universal network for students. This field requires a password and other information in order to gain access. 

**5.3 Computing Bias**

- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
- Bias in computers could be a good or bad thing
  - Example: netflix→ recommends shows based on genre interests
  - This is good for business because it gets more money if people stream on services longer

[HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)
- The owner of the computer thinks this was intentional but most likely being a bug in the software as it was not tested enough. 
- I think this happened because they tested the motion tracking of the face only using "white" models. 
- This can be very harmful and be percieved as racist and therefore should be corrected. 
- To produce a better outcome I would test the software with different face models of different types of skin color.

**5.4: Crowdsourcing**

Public Data Sets:
- Kaggle
- Google Public Datasets
-Data.gov
-Local Government
Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions and dissemination of results.
- Crowdsourcing can be seen in many places
  - Example: Wikipedia 
Distributed Computing:
- A ton of computers do 1 task
Examples:
- Spotify with collab playlists
- Crowdfunding like kickstarter and GoFundMe
- Blockchain like crypto and other tokens

1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- The 150 principes students could come together and find a way to help Ukraine fight against the Russian attacks. Crowdsourcing is essentially a group working together for a common goal so we intiate this idea in our enviroment by accepting donations and spreading the word.

2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- We could use the kids in Del Norte to work together to make Del Norte a better school and eradicate the lingering problems in our school. My final could be better with crowdsourcing as more brains can give us more ideas.
