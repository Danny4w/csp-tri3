#About Me

Hello! My name is Daniel Bertino, but you can call me Danny. I have an Italian heritage. I am fluent in Italian and during my high school career I have taken three years’ worth of Spanish, so I can speak it quite well too. Some of my main interests are outdoor-related activities. One of my favorite things to do in my spare time is travel. I have been to various parts of Europe and each year I would typically spend my summers traveling. Since all my family and relatives are in Italy I would go there to see them each year and hang out with my friends. Some of my other interests, besides traveling, are sailing, nature hikes, biking, and fishing. A big part of Italian culture is its food, architecture, and soccer. Soccer has always been one of my favorite sports since I was little so I like to play when I can. A field of study that I’m passionate about is Architecture and by traveling often I love to admire the uniqueness of building styles found in different countries. This year, I took computer science principles because I wanted to try to learn more about a different field just to get a solid background of how coding works as our world is shifting to a more technological phase.
