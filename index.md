# About Me

Hello! My name is [Daniel Bertino](https://github.com/Danny4w), but you can call me Danny. I am fluent in English, Italian and Spanish. Some of my main interests are outdoor-related activities. One of my favorite things to do in my spare time is travel. I've been to various parts of Europe and each year I would typically spend my summers traveling. Since all my family and relatives are in Italy I would go there to see them each year and hang out with my friends. Some of my other interests, besides traveling, are sailing, nature hikes, biking, and fishing. Soccer has also been one of my favorite sports since I was little, so I like to play when I can. A field of study that Iâ€™m passionate about is Architecture and by traveling often I love to admire the uniqueness of building styles found in different countries. This year, I took computer science principles because I wanted to try to learn more about a different field and get a background of how coding works as our world continues to become more digital.
