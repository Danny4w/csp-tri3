# About Me

Hello! My name is [Daniel Bertino](https://github.com/Danny4w), but you can call me Danny. I enjoy spending time outdoors and exploring new places. Growing up, I spent my summers in Italy with family and friends, which gave me a deep appreciation for different cultures and natural environments. I also enjoy going on nature walks and playing sports like basketball and soccer. One of my favorite classes so far has been architecture and design. After taking it my freshman year, I became interested in exploring other courses with a similar focus, such as environmental science. This ultimately sparked my passion for sustainable development. I admire how thoughtful design can work with nature to create spaces that are both functional and environmentally friendly. This year, I decided to take a computer science class because I wanted to learn more about the relationship between technology and sustainability, and gain some technical skills as our world becomes increasingly digital.
